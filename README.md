## What is a Nanodegree?　

A Nanodegree is a course offered by Udacity, where students can graduate and receive a certificate at the end. 

```
Become an expert in neural networks, and learn to implement them using the deep learning framework PyTorch.
Build convolutional networks for image recognition, recurrent networks for sequence generation, generative
adversarial networks for image generation, and learn how to deploy models.
