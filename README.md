## Purpose of this repository

The purpose of this repository is to catalogue all the information that i will gather while attending to the nanodegree. Also, i will have to do some projects in order to graduate, and they will be published here too.
　 　　 　　　
　 　　　
     　 　　　
## What is a Nanodegree?　

A Nanodegree is a course offered by Udacity, where students can graduate and receive a certificate at the end. 

```
Become an expert in neural networks, and learn to implement them using the deep learning framework PyTorch.
Build convolutional networks for image recognition, recurrent networks for sequence generation, generative
adversarial networks for image generation, and learn how to deploy models.
```
