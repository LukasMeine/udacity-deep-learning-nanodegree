## Project considerations:

- There is no README.md with install and configuration instructions.
- Exercise requires tensorflow version 1.3 or latest, but tensorflow defined in the requirements.txt is in the version 1.0
- Installed Tensorflow 1.3
- Had to install CUDA version 8 ( https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-80-ga2-download-archive )
- Had to install Cudnn version 6 ( https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/machine-learning/cudnn/secure/v6/prod/8.0_20170307/cudnn-8.0-windows10-x64-v6.0-zip )
